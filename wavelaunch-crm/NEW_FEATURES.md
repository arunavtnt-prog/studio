# 🚀 NEW FEATURES: Pre-Launch CRM Enhancements

## Overview

Your CRM has been transformed into a **Pre-Launch Management System** with 4 major new features designed to save you hours every day and eliminate manual work.

---

## ✨ Feature 1: Google Sheets Auto-Sync

### What It Does
Automatically imports creator applications from your Tally form (via Google Sheets) **every time you start the server**. No more manual data entry!

### How It Works
1. Tally form submissions → Google Sheets
2. Server starts → Auto-syncs new leads
3. AI analyzes each application
4. Deduplicates by email
5. All data mapped to CRM fields

### Setup (5 minutes)

**Option 1: Service Account (Recommended)**
1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Create project → Enable Google Sheets API
3. Create Service Account
4. Download JSON credentials
5. Share your Google Sheet with the service account email
6. Add to `.env`:
```env
GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL=your-service-account@project.iam.gserviceaccount.com
GOOGLE_PRIVATE_KEY="-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\n...\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n"
GOOGLE_SHEET_ID=your_spreadsheet_id
GOOGLE_SHEET_RANGE=Sheet1!A:Z
AUTO_SYNC_ON_STARTUP=true
AUTO_ANALYZE_NEW_LEADS=true
```

**Option 2: API Key (Simpler, for public sheets)**
```env
GOOGLE_SHEETS_API_KEY=your_api_key
GOOGLE_SHEET_ID=your_spreadsheet_id
AUTO_SYNC_ON_STARTUP=true
```

### Field Mapping
The sync service automatically maps your Tally form columns to the Lead model:
- **Your Full Name** → `name`
- **Email** → `email`
- **Do you have a specific industry or niche...** → `niche`
- All other questions → stored in `customFormAnswers` JSONB field

**Customize:** Edit `backend/src/services/sheetsService.js` → `mapSheetRowToLead()` function

### Manual Sync
```bash
POST /api/v1/launch/sync-sheets
{
  "spreadsheetId": "your_sheet_id",
  "range": "Sheet1!A:Z",
  "autoAnalyze": true
}
```

## ✨ Feature 2: Launch Readiness Dashboard

### What It Does
**Shows you at a glance who's ready to launch, who's stuck, and what needs your attention.**

### Key Metrics
- **Ready to Launch (90-100%)** - Green light, good to go
- **Almost Ready (70-89%)** - Close, minor items missing
- **In Progress (50-69%)** - Working through checklist
- **Needs Attention (<50%)** - Stuck or blocked

### Readiness Score Calculation (0-100)
- ✅ **Milestone Completion (40 points)** - Critical milestones done
- 📁 **File/Asset Completion (20 points)** - Brand files, contracts uploaded
- 💬 **Communication Activity (15 points)** - Recent engagement
- 📈 **Stage Progress (15 points)** - Movement through journey
- 📄 **Contract Status (10 points)** - Contract signed

### Automatic Blocker Detection
The system identifies:

- Unsigned contracts
- Missing brand files
- Behind schedule in stage
