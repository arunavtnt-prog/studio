## ‚ùì Troubleshooting

### Server Won't Start

**Problem**: Error when running start script

**Solution**:
1. Make sure Python 3.8+ is installed: `python --version`
2. Check if port 5000 is available (close other apps using it)
3. Try running manually: `python app.py`

### "API Key Not Found" Error

**Problem**: Environment validation fails

**Solution**:
1. Make sure `.env` file exists in the project folder
2. Check that API keys are properly set:
   ```
   ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-api...
   ```
3. Restart the server after adding keys

### Generation Fails

**Problem**: Error during business plan generation

**Solution**:
1. Check all required fields are filled
2. Verify your API key is valid
3. Check your internet connection
4. Try generating executive summary first (faster, tests setup)

### Page Won't Load

**Problem**: Browser shows "Can't connect" error

**Solution**:
1. Make sure the server is running (check terminal/command prompt)
2. Try http://localhost:5000 or http://127.0.0.1:5000
3. Check firewall isn't blocking port 5000
4. Restart the server

### PDF Generation Fails

**Problem**: Markdown generated but PDF failed

**Solution**:
1. This is usually okay - you still have the Markdown!
2. PDF requires system dependencies (Cairo, Pango)
3. On Mac: `brew install cairo pango gdk-pixbuf`
4. On Ubuntu: `sudo apt-get install libcairo2 libpango-1.0-0`
5. Or uncheck "Generate PDF" and just use Markdown
